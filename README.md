# breathe-25

## A Personal Project to Solidify, Consolidate and Build on my Web Dev Knowledge using HTML, CSS and JS.

### The Project sets out to create a platform to support the practice of mindful breathing to improve the well being of users.

#### This is my second attempt at building this app, I am taking some inspiration from the UX & UI found in the Balance App, whilst putting my own spin on the interface.

##### This project resonates with me, having some experience with breathwork and meditation and finding it very helpful in aiding relaxation, helping to build focus and supporting my mental health.

###### If you have any feedback please do get in touch

###### The Learning Journey

**This project has helped me to consolidate my knowledge of**

- @keyframes and animations in CSS

- working with the DOM

- how CSS is interpreted

**This project has helped me to learn new skills such as**

- Using data attributes in html

- setTimeout & setInterval in JS

- using pseudo elements (::before)

- UX/UI fundamentals

**This project has helped me to realise I can still learn a lot about**

- accesibility, how can I best design web applications for ALL users, I'd like to build using ARIA etc

- looks like I can still improve how I use markdown also

- git aswell, i only really commit and push to one branch...

**TO DO**

- implement cancel button

- look at the date object, how can I implement the countdowntimer so the seconds render 00:01

- get some feedback on UI/UX
