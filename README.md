# breathe-25

## A Personal Project to Solidify, Consolidate and Build on my Web Dev Knowledge using HTML, CSS and JS.

### The Project sets out to create a platform to support the practice of mindful breathing to improve the well being of users.

#### This is my second attempt at building this app, I am taking some inspiration from the UX & UI found in the Balance App, whilst putting my own spin on the interface.

##### This project resonates with me, having some experience with breathwork and meditation and finding it very helpful in aiding relaxation, helping to build focus and supporting my mental health.
